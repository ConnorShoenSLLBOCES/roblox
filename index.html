		<p>&nbsp; Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

		&nbsp; Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all American children under 16. Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation and microtransactions and accusations of exploitative practices directed toward children.</p>

			<h1>A Digital Menace!</h1>
			<p>JJJ: Welcome back, loyal listeners! It's your favorite truth-seeker, J. Jonah Jameson, here with another episode of Just the Facts! Today, we're tackling a topic that's been on my mind lately: Roblox. Now, Roblox, for those of you who've been living under a rock, is a digital playground where users can create, play, and socialize in virtual worlds. But let me tell you, folks, it's more than just harmless fun. It's a digital menace, lurking in the shadows of the internet. Think about it. Roblox lures in innocent children with promises of creativity and community, only to expose them to a cesspool of questionable content. From inappropriate games to virtual predators, it's a parent's worst nightmare. And don't even get me started on the microtransactions. It's like a never-ending cycle of consumerism, preying on impressionable young minds. It's downright despicable.  But what's perhaps most concerning about Roblox is its lack of accountability. Sure, they have guidelines and moderation systems in place, but they're about as effective as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. Scams, hacks, you name it – Roblox is riddled with them. Jarred, what's going on with this teleprompter? I can't work like this! Get it fixed, now! 
				<br>
				<br>
			Jarred: Sorry, boss! I'm on it!
				<br>
				<br>
			JJJ: Where was I? Ah, yes. Roblox. It's a digital cesspool, folks. And it's up to us, the consumers, to hold platforms like this accountable. We can't let them continue to prey on our children and exploit our wallets. 
				<br>
				<br>
			Well, it seems we've run into some technical difficulties, folks. But fear not, we'll be back with more hard-hitting truths next time. This is J. Jonah Jameson signing off. And remember, stay vigilant out there.</p>
