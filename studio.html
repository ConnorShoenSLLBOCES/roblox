		<p>Roblox allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio, which can then be played by other users. Games (called "experiences" by the corporation) are made with a derivative of the language Lua named Luau. Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions which can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products" or "products". The majority of games produced using Roblox Studio are developed by minors, and a total of 20 million games a year are produced using it.</p>

			<h1>A Digital Menace! PT. 2</h1>
				<p>JJJ: Welcome back, listeners! It's your old pal J. Jonah Jameson here, with another episode of Just the Facts! You know the drill, folks. No nonsense, no fluff, just the cold hard truth. Today, we're diving into a topic that's been buzzing around the internet lately: Roblox Studio. Now, for those of you living under a rock, Roblox Studio is the development engine behind the wildly popular online platform, Roblox. Think of it like a digital playground where users can create their own games, experiences, and even virtual worlds. But is it all fun and games? Or is there something more sinister lurking beneath the surface? Let's start with the basics. Roblox Studio provides users with a suite of tools to design and build their own virtual environments. From simple obstacle courses to complex multiplayer games, the possibilities are seemingly endless. But here's where things get interesting: while Roblox Studio may seem like harmless fun on the surface, it's also a breeding ground for all sorts of questionable content. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm all for creativity and expression. But when you have a platform that allows virtually anyone to create and publish their own content, you're bound to run into some issues. From inappropriate themes to downright offensive material, Roblox Studio has seen it all. And let's not forget about the monetization aspect. While Roblox itself is free to play, many developers use Studio to create games and experiences laden with microtransactions. It's like a virtual cash grab, preying on unsuspecting players, many of whom are children. But perhaps the most concerning aspect of Roblox Studio is its lack of oversight. Sure, there are guidelines and moderation systems in place, but they're far from foolproof. Time and time again, we've seen instances of inappropriate content slipping through the cracks, causing harm to players young and old. So, what's the solution? Well, for starters, Roblox needs to crack down on those who abuse the platform. Tighter moderation, stricter guidelines, you name it. And as for us, the consumers? We need to be more vigilant. Keep an eye on what our kids are playing, and speak up when we see something that doesn't sit right.

				Well, there you have it, folks. Another episode of Just the Facts in the books. Until next time, this is J. Jonah Jameson signing off. Stay safe out there.</p>
